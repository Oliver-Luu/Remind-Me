Welcome to iRemindMe!

This is my own personal passion project to try and create a better reminder app for both myself and those around me.
Currently, the built in Reminder App in iOS is too complicated for my liking, while the clock app lacks some functionality that I desire. 
As a result, I made my own reminder app to do solve both problems!

I hope you enjoy using my app!
